<h1> Welcome to the TS Dashboard
<h3>This Dashboard allows you to create experiments, check the status of experiments, and analyze data. For a full tutorial

<h2> Create Experiments </h2>
<br>
<p> In the create experiments tab, we walk you through the steps of creating a new experiment. To create an experiment, you need three valid experiment files (a protocol file, a conditions file, and an eventcodes file). These are described in more detail in the tabs located on the Create Experiments page.

<p> We monitor your progress as you enter data, making sure the values you entered are valid. You must enter a valid path for creating the folder structure. Ideally, this would be the dropbox path on your computer, but this is only necessary if you want to monitor your experiment in real time. If we can find a dropbox path on your computer, we'll automatically enter it for you in the appropriate field.

<p> Once everything is entered (and valid), we automatically show you the metadata for your experiment. We do this by reading your conditions file, and displaying the result. This allows you to verify that the information is correct (to a first approximation) before you click the 'Create Experiment' button. Once you click this button, we will automatically create the folder structure for you, moving the protocol, conditions, and eventcode files over.

<p> Once completed, an experimental folder structure is generated <br>

<h2> Box Checks </h2>
<br>
<p> In the Box Checks tab, you can automatically check the status of the operant chambers, as long as current experimental files exist (The notification dropdown in the upper right shows you if there are active experiment files). Clicking the tab currently monitors total food delivery (as a proxy for how much food the animals have eaten), the latency between a pellet delivery and its detection in the food cup, and the times that a pellet was delivered when the food cup was already blocked (either because a food was already there or because the pellet detector was dirty).

<br>
<h2> Analysis </h2>
<br>
<p> In the Analysis tab, you can find some simple tools to visualize your data. This is not meant to replace
    analyzing the data the old fashioned way, in code (both R and the TSLibrary make analysis straightforward).
    Instead, this tab is for very simple and quick visualizations. For now, there are ready-made plots for
    common procedures we use (in the Freestone lab), and this set may continue to expand. Further, you can
    enter simple filter, group by, and trial definition commands to explore your data further.

<br>
<h2> Misc </h2>
<br>
<p> Here you’ll find nothing of value, yet. But I imagine something useful will be here.
