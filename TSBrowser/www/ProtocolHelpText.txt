<h1> Building a protocol </h1>
<br>
<br>

<p> It is <strong>strongly</strong> recommended that you use a MedPC template to run your experiments. For example, the one used in the Freestone lab is <a target=“_blank”, href=https://github.com/freestone-lab/setup_experiment/blob/master/mouse/experiment/xx_protocol.mpc>here</a>

<p> The critical features of a good MedPC protocol template are that it automatically stores all input/output events in time.event format. This includes the automatic storing of all stimuli onsets and terminations, and all lever presses, head entries, etc. from the animal. And these are in time.event format so that the time of every event is stored in the data file.

<p> Your specific protocol may have additional event codes. For example, you may want to create an event code that indicates when the trial starts. These should be written to the data file in time.event format, too.

<p> Your protocol should be named “*_protocol.mpc” where * is a stand-in for your unique experiment ID (e.g., “h_protocol.mpc”).
