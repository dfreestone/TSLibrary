<h1> Building an eventcodes file </h1>
<br>
<br>

<p> Your event codes file should be named “*_eventcodes.csv,” where the * is a stand-in for your unique experiment ID. For example, valid filenames may be “h_eventcodes.csv” or “ge_eventcodes.csv,” but “eventcodes.csv” is not valid.

<p> Your event codes file should contain a list of name,code pairs. The <em>name</em> and the <em>code</em> values should be separated by a comma. You should not include a header row. Each event code should be on its own line. Your event codes file may look like this

<br>
<br>
Trial_start, 61 <br>
Trial_end, 62 <br>
Trial_fi, 63 <br>
Trial_peak, 64 <br>

<p> Note that your event codes file should not contain the events already contained in the “eventcodes.csv” file in the dropbox/system folder. The “eventcodes.csv” should contain all the standard codes for your equipment (e.g., head entries, stimulus onsets, etc.)
