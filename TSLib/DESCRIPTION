Version: 0.1.0
Author: David Freestone
Maintainer: David Freestone <dmf025@bucknell.edu>
Description: These tools are specific to operating on timestamped behavioral
    data These timestampes are usually time in seconds from the start of a session.
    They differ from other timestamped data because the events at each timestamp
    come from different categories (i.e, present a stimulus, collect a response)
